Here you can play some Slitherlink problems.

Problems are made by [Penciloid](https://github.com/semiexp/penciloid) Slitherlink Generator.
The generator has been highly improved, compared to the previous one (in 2011).
Now it can produce a problem (10x10) of any (possible) given placement of hints in approximately 0.1[sec].
